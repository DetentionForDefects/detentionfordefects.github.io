A musician in the heart of OKC.   
We focus on experimental music that incorporates retro sound.   

We are known for:
* Eating cactus
* Riding on the backs of rocket powered buffalo
* Rocketing through space on a dirtball ship
* Mattress tag collages

With your support we can add music to that list.
