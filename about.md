I began my musical journey creating chiptunes for a videogame.  Along the way I discovered I enjoyed making music more than I enjoyed making games.  Maybe because music is a game in itself?   

My chiptune origins will sneak into my work from time to time so don't be surprised if you hear a gameboy in the mix.

I like making chill beats that lift people up.   

Know that I'm glad to have you along for this trip.  Many good things to come my friends.
